# 📘 Day 1 – AWS Pricing Models

🎯 Task: Understand AWS Pricing Models

AWS gives different ways to pay for cloud services:

- **On-Demand (Pay-as-you-go):** Pay only when you use. Best for short-term or testing.  
- **Reserved Instances:** Commit for 1–3 years. Best for steady, long-term use. Saves big money.  
- **Spot Instances:** Use spare capacity at huge discounts. Best for flexible jobs, but can be stopped anytime.  

👉 Think of it like transport:  
- On-Demand = Uber ride (flexible).  
- Reserved = Bus pass (cheap if you commit).  
- Spot = Last-minute flight deal (super cheap but not guaranteed).
